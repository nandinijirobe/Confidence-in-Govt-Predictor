The "Government Confidence Predictor" project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the confidence in national government scores based on the World Happiness Report (WHR) dataset. This is a regression problem, aiming to forecast the level of confidence that a country's citizens have in their respective national governments.

In today's globalized world, political stability is closely linked to economic and business opportunities. This predictive model holds potential for various stakeholders, particularly companies and non-profit organizations, in understanding the dynamics of government confidence and its impacts on the socio-economic landscape.
