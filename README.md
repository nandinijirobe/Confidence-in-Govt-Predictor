# üèõÔ∏è Confidence-in-Govt-Predictor üßê

## Overview
The "Government Confidence Predictor" project utilizes a KNN model and other machine learning techniques to predict the confidence in national government scores based on the World Happiness Report (WHR) dataset. This is a regression problem, aiming to forecast the level of confidence that a country's citizens have in their respective national governments. My model was able to achieve an RMSE score of 0.12 and an R^2 score of 0.57.

In today's globalized world, political stability is closely linked to economic and business opportunities. This predictive model holds potential for various stakeholders, particularly companies and non-profit organizations, in understanding the dynamics of government confidence and its impacts on the socio-economic landscape.
